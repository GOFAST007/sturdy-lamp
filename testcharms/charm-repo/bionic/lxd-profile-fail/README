# Overview

Just an Ubuntu image with not much else running, includes a failing lxd-profile.yaml for juju

# Usage

juju deploy lxd-profile-fail --force

## Known Limitations and Issues

It doesn't do much, but it does get you a machine you can play with, as quickly
as I could make it.  The force flag is required to deploy this charm.

# Configuration

None
